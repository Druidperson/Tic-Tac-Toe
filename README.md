# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
https://hyperskill.org/projects/73

This is the second project I chose to complete on Jetbrains Academy. It is also the second and last project in the "Challenging" category. This project taught me a lot about list comprehensions and nested list comprehensions. I definitely have issues with them and will need to practice in the future. This was also the first time I worked with a try, except, else, finally block and it did add a layer of complexity that I did not except.
